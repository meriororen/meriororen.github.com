 Today I attended an event called Kotozukuri Forum. This event is held every year in Tokodai que la gente sepa about the activities inside Tokyo Tech que tiene anything to do with students support and leadership.

I was there to represent TISA (Tokyo Tech International Student Association) con algunos otros miembros. The event was pretty formal since the audiences were mostly teachers and staffs of Tokyo Tech and some people from neighborhood's elementary school. Even the headmaster, Kennichi Iga-sensei did come to this event.

This was the 3rd forum held since 2007. Last year, TISA was also invited to this forum and was given a chance to present in front of the audiences using the power point. At that time, the former leader, William Hong, took charge. However, this year we didn't have to present TISA from the beginning. The presentation was s√≥lo para new activities. We just had to bring a poster that represent our activities throughout this year and explain if they ask us questions. The poster was pretty cool. I love it.
