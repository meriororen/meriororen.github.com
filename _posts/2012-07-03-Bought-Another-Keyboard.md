 Today I can no longer ignore the fact that my mac is hot. I mean, literally hot. It
 gets hotter if I use it on the bed while I am lying.
 And I no longer feel comfortable typing on it anymore, so I bought a
 new keyboard. 
 
 Actually, I wanted to buy keyboard for quite a while, but
 because I already have 2 keyboards which I got from my friend already,
 I always hesitate to buy a new one. Today I didn't want to use either
 of the two keyboards I have. They're too big, and the keys are not
 comfortable. After a while using mac, I got used to the shallow keys, I
 think they're nice because I don't have to 
 press too hard to type. So I bought one with shallow keys and without
 the number pad, since I never use it anyway. The price was 2480 yen,
 quite cheap
 for a wireless keyboard.
 
 So far there are no problem, except that I
 have to adapt with windows layout (again). Also, it's a little bit
 crampy, but it's okay.
